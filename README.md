# Audacious NSIS Windows Installer

This creates a Windows installer for Audacious using (ironically) the
[Nullsoft Scriptable Install System](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)
(NSIS). Just run `make` to build it,

    make

The Windows build is fetched from the official website and converted
into an installer.
